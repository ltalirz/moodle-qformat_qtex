Labels and references.%
}

    Besides labels and references you can use any \LaTeX. Anywhere.

    If you plan on importing to Moodle, write plain text and use LaTeX only in math mode.

}

\question{%
    Why bother with feedbacks and explanations, when they're optional?
}
\false{%
    Exactly. I never do anything optional. That's why it's optional, right?
}
\true{%
    We encourage you to make deliberate use of feedbacks and explanations.
Your students will be grateful for your efforts.
